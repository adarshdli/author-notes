## Access restriction based on the usability of UDF

### Oct 2019 -  # 17158

The actual number of level of interview is decided on the run basis, for example once a candidate is through from one round of Interview, only then HR will decided if another round of interview is required , if yes - with whom. Hence, while addressing the number of the interview level, the client required the RMM system to allow the Interviewer to enter comments only in the field dedicated ( marked) for the respective person. (Viz Interviewer 1 Comments, Interviewer 2 Comments, Interviewer 3 Comments). Further, no other interviewer should be able to edit the comments of other interviewer.

Currently, in the Interview assessment section, Interviewer 1 is able to fill the comment section of Interviewer 2, & this should be restricted.  

In order to implement the change,Â the unwanted user defined fields (ex: interviewer 1,2,3 comments) was removed and just one field named  Interviewer Comments  was kept.
